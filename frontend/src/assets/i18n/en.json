Cookies are small text files or other storage technologies that are placed and stored on your terminal device by the Internet browser you use. Through these cookies, certain information from you, such as your browser or location data or your IP address, is processed to an individual extent.  \nThis processing makes our website more user-friendly, effective and secure, as the processing enables, for example, the reproduction of our website in different languages or the offer of a shopping cart function.\nThe legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit b.) DSGVO, insofar as these cookies data are processed for contract initiation or contract execution.\nIf the processing does not serve the purpose of initiating or executing a contract, our legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website.

The data collected by us in this process will be used exclusively for the provision of the customer account. \nInsofar as you consent to this processing, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR is the legal basis for the processing.\nIf the opening of the customer account also serves pre-contractual measures or the fulfillment of the contract, the legal basis for this processing is also Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR.\nThe consent given to us for the opening and maintenance of the customer account can be revoked at any time with effect for the future in accordance with Art. 7 (3) GDPR.

To do this, you only need to inform us of your revocation.\nIn addition, we also process your IP and e-mail address. The IP address is processed because we have a legitimate interest in initiating or supporting further steps if your contribution infringes the rights of third parties and/or it is otherwise illegal.\nThe legal basis in this case is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.
